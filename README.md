This HTML & Javascript website is part of two online courses called ["Build Microservices with .NET and Amazon Web Services"](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-microservices-with-aspnet-core-amazon-web-services/?referralCode=B288BF33506B34292176) and ["Master Event-Driven Microservices with Python and AWS"](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-microservices-with-python-aws/?referralCode=4727A2957A33ED2E4226)

The purpose of this website is to act as the front-end for a microservices-based Hotel Booking system developed during the courses mentioned above. This straightforward website is designed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It takes the complexity of using a more sophisticated Javascript framework such as React or Angular away and lets students focus on learning Microservices and their development in AWS.

The course explains how a microservices-based system is developed and what relevant design patterns are applied in scenarios.
